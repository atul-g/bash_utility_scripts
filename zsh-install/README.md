# Minimal Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh installation script

This script simply installs Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh, along with Pure theme and zsh-autosuggestions plugins. I made this script to quickly install and start using Zsh in any new OS/VM that I install.

This script should work in any operating system having one of these package managers: `dnf`, `pacman`, `apt`.

### Usage
Just run `./min-zsh-install.sh` in your bash shell. The scripts should install zsh and also make it your default shell.

### Note
The script requires `git` to download and install `Oh-My-Zsh` and `zsh-autosuggestions`.
