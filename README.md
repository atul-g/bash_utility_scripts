# UTILITY BASH SCRIPTS

A repo for simple utility bash scripts that I use freqeuntly.

## LIST OF SCRIPTS:
1. temp_calc: CPU Temperature Calculator during stress test.
2. bulk_file_rename: Renaming all the files in numerical order in the specified directory. By default it renames to ".jpg" extension.
