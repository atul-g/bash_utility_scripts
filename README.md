A repo for simple utility bash scripts that I use freqeuntly.

## List Of Scripts:
1. `temp_calc`: CPU Temperature Calculator during stress test.
2. `bulk_file_rename`: Renaming all the files in numerical order in the specified directory. By default it renames to ".jpg" extension.
3. `wifi_usage`: WIFI usage counter over all connected WIFIs for a month. Shows the Usage details using another script in MiBs.
4. `video_time_calc`: Script that sums up the time of all the videos inside the directory which is passed as argument.
5. `kernel_compilation`: Script to compile and install Linux kernel from source repository in Arch based distros.
6. `battery_monitor`: A script that checks the battery status and sends notification to user if the charge capacity is over 60% to prevent improper charge cycles and help reduce battery capacity detoriation.
